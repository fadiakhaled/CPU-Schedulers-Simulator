Java program to simulate CPU Schedulers: <br>
#### 1. Preemptive Shortest-Job First (SJF) Scheduling
SJF Scheduling is one of the CPU scheduling algorithms in which the process that has the smallest execution time (burst time) is chosen for the next exectuion. Preemptive SJF is also called Shortest-Remaining-Time-First (SRTF). in SRTF If a process arrives with a shorter execution time than that of the current executing process, the current process will be removed from executuion and the CPU cycle is allocated to the process with the shorter burst time. 
    
#### 2. Round Robin (RR) Scheduling 
The Round robin scheduling algorithm is one of the CPU scheduling algorithms in which every process gets a fixed amount of time quantum to execute the process. Once a process is executed for given time period. Process is pre-empted and added to the end of the ready queue and other process executes for given time period.
